"""
For this exercise you will write a program to calculate the total of a user's shopping cart and the amount of change he/she is owed given the amount they wish to pay.

Requirements:

  - Your store will offer at least three items. Your program will prompt the user to enter the number of each item they wish to purchase.
  - At least one of the items must have a price that is not a whole number.
  - Your program will display for the user the total amount owed.
  - Your program will prompt the user to enter the amount of payment.
  - If the payment is less than the amount owed, your program will tell the user they are short and exit.
  - If the payment is more than the amount owed, your program will calculate the user's change. You will display for the user the number of $20, $10, $5, $1, quarters, nickels, dimes, and pennies to be returned.
  - Your store may offer any three (or more) items. 

Hints:
  
  - It is not required to use loops. Remember, you can use the / // and % operators. 

Below are three example executions of a sample program.
